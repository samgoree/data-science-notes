# Chapter 3: Numpy

This page describes the Python library Numpy, short for Numerical Python and usually pronounced "nuhm-pie." Numpy is a framework for numerical computing which allows Python programs to run much faster code from older C++ and Fortran libraries such as [lapack](https://netlib.org/lapack/) and [libfft](https://github.com/pyroesp/libFFT). which serves as the foundation for the entire Data Science Python Stack. Along with Numpy, we will introduce some basic statistical tools for summarizing data.

## Importing Python Libraries

Python is a general-purpose programming language. While it has some built-in functions, it lacks most of the operations that we want to do in data science. To make Python into a data science program, we have to import external libraries which are designed for this purpose.

### Example: math

The `math` library contains mathematical constants and functions. For example, if we wanted to compute the area of a circle from its radius:

```python
import math
radius = 6
area = math.pi * radius ** 2
area
```

Out: `113.09733552923255`

In the first line, we use the `import` keyword to import the math library. We can then access the mathematical constant Pi (3.1415...) and use it in our (hopefully familiar) calculation: 
$$
a = \pi r^2
$$

### Example: datetime

Another Python library that is quite useful is the `datetime` library. This library contains several functions for working with dates and times. For example, if we want to know the current time:

```python
from datetime import datetime
right_now = datetime.now()
```

Out: `datetime.datetime(2024, 6, 10, 15, 41, 12, 599871) `

The first line of code uses the `import` keyword (which we discuss in the next section) to import the datetime module from the datetime library. The second line calls the `now()` function from the datetime module which returns an object representing the current time.

This is a datetime.datetime object representing a specific moment in time. It shows seven numbers associated with my current time. I wrote the first draft of this chapter on June 10th 2024 at 3:41pm and 12.599871 seconds.

### Three Kinds of Imports

There are three ways of importing Python libraries. All of them use the `import` keyword and the name of a library, but they have subtle differences.

1. `import libraryname`. This imports libraryname. We can access its elements using `libraryname.functionname`. For example:

   ```
   import math
   math.sin(math.pi / 2)
   ```

   Out: `1.0`

2. `import libraryname as lbn`. This imports libraryname, but renames it to a shorthand, in this case, lbn. We can access its elements using the shorthand, which saves a lot of keystrokes. For example:

   ```python
   import datetime as dt
   half_past_noon = dt.time(12,30,0)
   ```

   Out: `datetime.time(12,30)`, a time object corresponding to 12:30pm.

3. `from libraryname import functionname`. This only imports a specific function, functionname, from libraryname. We can access functionname by calling it directly, without the need for the library name. For example:

   ```python
   from datetime import time
   half_past_noon = time(12,30,0)
   ```

   A majority of the imports we will do in data science will be of the second type.

## The Data Science Python Stack

In computer science, we refer to a collection of programming tools that build on each other a "tech stack." In data science, we use the "Data Science Python" stack. This is a collection of open source Python libraries that build on one another.

You're already familiar with Python and Jupyter. IPython is a program that Jupyter uses to run your code interactively (that's why they're called IPython Notebooks, or .ipynb files). In this chapter, we are covering Numpy. In Chapter {{chapter_pandas}} we will talk about Pandas. In {{chapter_matplotlib}}, we will talk about Matplotlib and mention Seaborn. In {{chapter_regression}} we will use tools from Scipy and scikit-learn, and reference StatsModels.

## Importing Numpy

We will import the numpy library using a common shorthand:

```python
import numpy as np
```

This allows us to use the features of the numpy library by writing `np.something`. We typically put this line of code (along with all other import statements) in a cell at the top of our notebook. For the rest of the chapter, we will be assuming this line of code has been run already.

## Numpy Arrays

Numpy's central contribution is a new data structure called a N-dimensional array. We can make n dimensional arrays from Python lists:

```python
lst = [1,1,1,2,2,2]
arr = np.array(lst)
arr
```

Out: `array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2])`

The key feature of numpy arrays is their ability to represent nested lists and operate on them efficiently. Numpy manages to do that by imposing two key restrictions on its arrays.

1. Numpy arrays must only contain elements of a single data type (e.g. int, float)
2. Nested numpy arrays must all have the same length.

For example:

```
invalid_array = [1, 'a']
invalid_2d_array = [[1,2], [1]]
```

Both `invalid_array` and `invalid_2d_array` are valid Python lists, but would be invalid if converted to Numpy arrays. `invalid_array` is an invalid numpy array because it contains mixed data types, but it would not cause an error, as numpy will cast both types to "object". `invalid_2d_array` is actually invalid and will result in an error.

### Indexing Numpy Arrays

We can access individual elements of a numpy array using the same square bracket notation from Python lists.

```
arr = np.array([1,3,5,7,9])
arr[3]
```

Out: `7`

Instead of using multiple indices, we can index multiple numpy arrays using indices separated by commas.

```
lst = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
arr = np.array(lst)
lst[1][2], arr[1,2]
```

Out: `6, 6`, indicating that both expressions are equivalent.

### Slicing Numpy Arrays

Just like we can slice Python lists using a `:` inside their indices, we can slice Numpy arrays.

### Shape

Just like we can use the `len()` function on lists to find their length, we can find the length of a Numpy array.

```
lst = [[1,2],[4,5],[7,8]]
arr = np.array(lst)
len(arr)
```

Out: `3`, since the length of the outer list is 3.

Additionally, since all valid numpy arrays have same-length nested arrays, we can see those lengths as well using a property called .shape

```python
lst = [[1,2],[4,5],[7,8]]
arr = np.array(lst)
arr.shape
```

Out: `(3,2)`, because the outer array has length 3 and each inner array has length 2. Notice that shape is a property, not a method. It is called without parentheses.

It is helpful to think about these arrays as rectangles:

| Indices | 0    | 1    |
| ------- | ---- | ---- |
| 0       | 1    | 2    |
| 1       | 4    | 5    |
| 2       | 7    | 8    |

The shape is the length by the width.

One dimensional arrays of length n have shape `(n,)`. The comma is included to show that it is still a tuple. Notice the length of an array's shape yields its dimensionality.

Shape scales to higher dimensional arrays as well:

```python
three_dimensional_arr = np.array([
    [
        [1, 2], [3, 4], [5,6]
    ], [
        [7, 8], [9,10],[11,12]
    ], [
        [13,14],[15,16],[17,18]
    ], [
        [19,20],[21,22],[23,24]
    ]
])
three_dimensional_arr.shape
```

Out: `(4, 3, 2)` The 4 refers to the outer array with four subarrays. The three refers to each subarray with three subarrays. The 2 refers to each array of length two containing integers.

Notice that the product of the shape (4 * 3 * 2) yields the total number of elements (24). In our rectangle analogy, this is the volume of a solid prism.

### dtype

Another property of numpy arrays which is potentially relevant to data science is their data type, which we can access through the `.dtype` property. Since all of the values inside an array are of the same type, we can check that type for the full array. Numpy uses very specific types from C++ to describe its arrays, such as:

* uint8: an *unsigned* 8 bit integer: an int which can only hold values from 0 to 255 and cannot be negative.
* int32: a signed 32 bit integer: an integer which can range from -2^31 to 2^31, this is similar to Python's normal int type
* float64: a 64 bit floating point type, which can represent values as small as 2^-1075 and as large as 2^1075.

In these types, the information capacity of the number is specified in *bits*. Bits are binary digits, either 0 or 1. In general, a n-bit binary representation can hold 2^n possible values, since each bit is either 0 or 1. From this lens, integer and float are just different ways of arranging those 2^32 or 2^64 different possible values along the number line which are useful for different tasks.

### Vectorized Arithmetic

<details><summary>Review: Vectors</summary>You may have encountered vectors in a prior math or physics course. A vector is a mathematical object that can be represented in three ways: a point in space, a list of coordinates or a direction and a distance. Vectors are one of the basic objects of study in linear algebra and have many uses in data science. For a more comprehensive introduction to vectors, please consult a mathematics textbook, e.g. <a href="https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Precalculus/Book%3A_Precalculus__An_Investigation_of_Functions_(Lippman_and_Rasmussen)/08%3A_Further_Applications_of_Trigonometry/8.04%3A_Vectors">Lippman & Rasmussen</a>. In these notes, we will represent N-dimensional vectors using numpy arrays of shape (N,). Notice that vectors of any dimension are still one-dimensional arrays.</details>

One of the most powerful features of numpy is its *vectorized* operations, which apply a single mathematical operator to an array element by element. For example:

```
a = np.array([1,2])
b = np.array([4,5])
a + b
```

Out: `array([5, 7])`

Recall this is not how python lists work. For python lists, the + operator is used for concatenation.

The same is true for subtraction, multiplication and division:

```
a - b, a * b, a / b
```

Out: `array([-3, -3]), array([4, 10]), array([0.25, 0.4])`

We can also substitute a scalar (e.g. a Python int or float) into any of these operations:

```
arr = np.array([3,4,5])
arr + 2, arr - 2, arr * 2, arr / 2
```

Out: `(array([5, 6, 7]), array([1, 2, 3]), array([ 6,  8, 10]), array([1.5, 2. , 2.5]))`

Notice that division converts all the elements of the array into floats in order to accurately represent 1.5 and 2.5, displaying 2 as `2.` to show that it is a float.

### Dot Products in Numpy

The multiplication symbol * performs vectorized multiplication:
$$
a = (a_1, a_2,...,a_n)\\
b = (b_1, b_2,...,b_n)\\
a * b = (a_1 * b_1, a_2 * b_2, ..., a_n * b_n)
$$
In linear algebra, this is an unusual vector product. Mathematicians are more familiar with the "dot product" (also called scalar product or inner product):
$$
a \cdot b = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n
$$
We can compute the dot product between two one-dimensional numpy arrays using the @ operator

```
a = np.array([2,3])
b = np.array([2,4])
a @ b
```

Out: `16`, as 2\*2 + 3\*4 = 4 + 12 = 16

On two-dimensional arrays, the @ symbol performs matrix multiplication on the last two dimensions. For example:

```
mat_a = np.array([[2,3],[4,5],[6,7]])
mat_b = np.array([[1,-2],[-2,1]])
mat_a @ mat_b
```

Out: `array([[-4, -1], [-6, -3], [-8, -5]]) `
