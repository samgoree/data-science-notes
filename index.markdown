This page contains draft notes for DSC105 at Stonehill College.

I'm writing these notes because there is no data science textbook at the appropriate level for this class. DSC105 is a data science class with no prerequisites at a small college that fulfills our science requirement, so it serves as both an introduction to programming as well as a more standard introduction to data manipulation, exploration and statistical analysis using programming tools.

These notes overlap with, but do not mirror, the DSC105 course. In class, we also talk about topics related to the job of a data scientist, the data science process and its relationship to the scientific method, data collection, data exploration and understanding, statistical modeling and ethical issues involving data and society.
