This page contains draft notes for DSC105 at Stonehill College.

These are a **draft**! There may be things in this course which are not reflected in these notes. If you find something wrong or missing, please report it at [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvrIiWrgCSJJFftArdwjhM3TBc6egVZOg1O1qJEgiaSnwujw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

I've written these notes because there is no data science textbook at the appropriate level for this class. DSC105 is a data science class with no prerequisites at a small college, so it serves as both an introduction to programming as well as a more standard introduction to data manipulation, exploration and statistical analysis. Other physical textbooks or online resources are mostly targeted towards students with some programming experience, or do not cover the specific libraries we use.

These notes overlap with, but do not mirror, the DSC105 course. In class, we also talk about topics related to the job of a data scientist, the data science process and its relationship to the scientific method, data collection, data exploration and understanding, statistical modeling and ethical issues involving data and society.
